<p>“From natural disasters to power outages, these events, even geographically-localized ones, often result in widespread disruptions across the air transportation network. In order to engineer resilience and design better proactive mitigation strategies, it is important to identify, characterize, and control the effects of such disruptions. A more resilient and well-prepared air transportation system directly translates to mitigated delay costs and increased service quality. In this thesis, we explore new metrics to quantify/identify disruptions, and develop innovative strategies to prescribe actions to mitigate its impacts and hasten network recovery,” explains Li.</p>



<p>Li recently won two best paper awards for Network Management and UAS/UAM/AAM at the International Conference on Research in Air Transportation (ICRAT 2022), a joint FAA-Eurocontrol sponsored biennial conference.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is a sadness in the FXB Atrium now when walking past the Apollo 9 and Gemini 4 exhibits, noting the passing of esteemed astronaut and Michigan alum Jim McDivitt.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="180" height="260" src="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/James_McDivitt.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5236" srcset="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/James_McDivitt.jpg 180w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/James_McDivitt-83x120.jpg 83w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" /></figure></div>


<p>An astronaut on two space missions during a pivotal time in NASA’s space program, McDivitt played a crucial role in our country’s space history.</p>



<p>Selected as the pilot for the Gemini 4 mission, McDivitt led the team who conducted the first spacewalk. Ed White, the second member of Gemini 4 conducted the spacewalk. Both were University of Michigan alums. McDivitt later commanded the Apollo 9 mission to test lunar landing technologies, paving the way for the first moon landing.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/McDivitt_nasa.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5558" width="800" height="685" srcset="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/McDivitt_nasa.jpg 800w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/McDivitt_nasa-300x257.jpg 300w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/McDivitt_nasa-768x658.jpg 768w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/McDivitt_nasa-724x620.jpg 724w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/McDivitt_nasa-120x103.jpg 120w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/McDivitt_nasa-350x300.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>Hanging up his flight suit, McDivitt spent the next decade at NASA working to build and manage the space program. He was connected to the university over the years through his extensive alumni network of astronauts (in addition to White, the three members of the Apollo 15 mission were all from U-M). He worked closely with U-M faculty, including Harm Burning, who taught astrodynamics to NASA astronauts.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Aero alumna leading Airbus U.S. space systems shares her experience and advice
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Michigan Aerospace caught up with alumna and Industry Advisory Board member Debra Facktor recently to learn more about her career, her experience at U-M, and her advice for students.</strong></p>



<p></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/facktor-portrait.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3174" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/facktor-portrait.jpg 350w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/facktor-portrait-300x300.jpg 300w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/facktor-portrait-150x150.jpg 150w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/facktor-portrait-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></figure></div>


<p>Debra Facktor is the Head of U.S. Space Systems for Airbus U.S. Space &amp; Defense, Inc.&nbsp; She focuses her work on National Security Space and Space Exploration and serves on the board of Airbus OneWeb Satellites, a joint venture of Airbus and OneWeb in Florida that manufactures small satellites for OneWeb’s commercial satellite constellation and for Airbus commercial and government customers. . Before that, she was the Vice President and General Manager of Strategic Operations for Ball Aerospace, where she oversaw strategic development as well as marketing and communications. But before all of this, Facktor was a student at U-M.</p>



<p>A third generation Wolverine born in Ann Arbor and raised in the Detroit area, Facktor grew up thinking she would attend the University of Michigan. She never doubted where she wanted to go to school, but what she would study on campus was another matter. At a career day in Detroit hosted by the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), she heard a woman talk about seeing a car she designed driving down the road. Although Facktor wasn’t particularly excited about cars, this put engineering on the map for her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With engineering on her mind, NASA sealed the deal when it launched the first space shuttle in 1981. <em>This is it</em>, she thought. <em>Aerospace. I want to do things that haven’t been done before.</em> This principle is what guided her entire career, and to this day Facktor remains true to it.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="200" height="202" src="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/Factor-UM.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5543" srcset="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/Factor-UM.jpg 200w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/Factor-UM-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></figure></div>


<p>Going to U-M shaped Facktor’s career in multiple ways. She created a tight-knit community that still remains strong today. She comments, “Going to U-M and gaining the academic and social experiences are like a connective tissue. It’s still real today &#8211; with all alumni. I consider U-M and the Aerospace department like family. Our community is super strong.”</p>



<p>On campus Facktor was the president of SWE. She joined AIAA as a freshman and today she’s a Fellow, alongside many other aerospace faculty, and is active on the Honors and Awards Committee. She was in a sorority and was a class officer in SGT, extracurriculars that one may think are decorative but to her are essential. By participating in them, Facktor learned how to build and organize teams and, most importantly, how to lead them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When hiring people, look for the extracurriculars,” Facktor said. “Engineers can be labeled introverted, but they all have something going on that shows their passion and determination. What started on campus for me still exists today. I’m involved in a lot of groups that either match my values or are focused on aerospace and supporting women in a variety of Aerospace capacities.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="534" src="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/debra-facktor-nasa.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5542" srcset="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/debra-facktor-nasa.jpg 800w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/debra-facktor-nasa-300x200.jpg 300w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/debra-facktor-nasa-768x513.jpg 768w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/debra-facktor-nasa-120x80.jpg 120w, https://aero.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/debra-facktor-nasa-350x234.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">NASA photo caption: June 2019 &#8211; at SpaceX launch in Florida for the NASA Green Propellant Infusion Mission (GPIM) , by Ball Aerospace.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Eventually, Facktor became an expert in rocket engines and launch vehicles (which is ironic given her initial disinterest in cars) and then worked in early start-ups Kistler Aerospace Corp and AirLaunch LLC that influenced the landscape of the commercial launch industry. When joining Ball Aerospace, she shifted to satellites, and today she runs the space business unit at Airbus U.S. Space &amp; Defense. A lot of her work is focused on small satellites, with a manufacturing plant in Florida (just outside the NASA Kennedy Space Center) and a team based in Houston flying payloads on the International Space Station (ISS).</p>



<p>After over 30 years in the aerospace industry, Facktor reflects upon what made her truly love her job, and for her there are two essential things: being part of a great team with a great cultural environment and doing truly important work. Today, Facktor’s team is part of the U.S. national defense space architecture by providing satellites for space constellations – a truly challenging and rewarding feat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking back at her time at the University of MIchigan, Facktor shared a few words of wisdom for current students:</p>

<p>“Make the most of your experience. Be engaged, get involved, go to football games. Feel the Michigan spirit and the community of aerospace. Ask for help when you need it: you are not alone. Friends, faculty, everyone is willing to help… Always be open minded to creativity. Aerospace is inherently risky, so have curiosity… and actively seek out different views. The power is in collaboration, community, sharing, diversity. Always be learning– be a learner, not a knower.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A conversation with accomplished alumnus, Karen Albrecht]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It was the Fall of 1972. NASA Johnson Space Center came to campus hoping to recruit a significant number of engineers, particularly seeking female aerospace leaders who may be interested in working at NASA. Naturally, they called the Society of Women Engineers at the University of Michigan (SWE) hoping to connect with prospective recruits. Karen Albrecht was head of the society at the time, and she picked up the phone. She was the only member graduating that winter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She was interviewed over lunch. Albrecht remembers going into the Michigan Union’s fancy dining room afterwards to continue the conversation, which she thought at the time went really well. However, when weeks had gone by and she hadn’t heard back, she began to doubt. As she fielded seven job offers, she was anxiously waiting to hear back from NASA before making a decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, one day the department secretary interrupted a professor&#8217;s class, requesting that Karen come take NASA’s phone call. She was told they unearthed her resume and it was on its way into the right hands in the organization. From there, she was offered her dream job to join NASA. It was worth the wait.</p>



<p>At NASA Johnson Space Center, Albrecht developed analytic methods for composite primary structure under static and dynamic loads for the Space Shuttle. She was part of the test group who helped establish physical attributes to select women to become astronauts, which led to her involvement in the Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health (LSAH). She then moved onto Lockeed Martin, where she worked on Missile Launching Systems, Basic Research, Commercial Aircraft, Undersea Systems, SMART Structures, Robotics and high-performance Military Aircraft. She developed embedded fiber optics technology and is a Master Black Belt in 6-sigma and Lean Engineering. She retired as head of engineering at the LM facility in Marietta, GA.</p>



<p>But before accomplishing all that, Albrecht was the only female student in her class at U-M. She even remained the only woman in the department for a few years. She had a fierce determination to prove anyone who didn’t believe in her wrong– and sometimes, that meant the university itself. Despite being told by many people at various levels in the university, including her counselor, that she didn’t belong here and wouldn’t succeed, she did.</p>



<p>Despite this (or perhaps, in part, because of it), Albrecht worked very hard during school and graduated in 3.5 years. Her favorite experience as a student was the flight test course taught by Professor Lesher, where she got the chance to fly over her parents house in Flint. This course helped her realize why she was doing all that work: it showed her what could be accomplished.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Albrecht is quite involved with the university.&nbsp;She’s&nbsp;been integral in the new model-based systems engineering courses,&nbsp;which she’s been pushing the university to teach since she joined the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB), over 20 years ago. Her longstanding role is driven by a passion for enhancing the Aerospace curriculum with industry-perspective training.</p>



<p>Albrecht is currently the CEO of Karen Albrecht Enterprises, a Career and Personal Development Organization. She has delivered over 200 seminars for courses she developed and happily gives her time and knowledge to students looking to navigate career fairs and improve their resumes. She has also set up an endowment fund for Aerospace undergraduate education and provides scholarships for Aerospace Engineering students at the University of Michigan who need the support to finish their education. Her generosity has already helped more than ten Aero students pay for their studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karen has seen and experienced the financial struggle that many students face. “I left college with a college loan greater than my starting salary. As my career evolved I was able to move from mentoring students to supporting them financially. You can find ways to give back to help others even when you have to pay off college debt,” she reflects.</p>



<p>Albrecht also has a few words of wisdom to Aerospace students today. She says, “I encourage every Aero student to get on a team to gain hands-on experience. Having a team-based mentality is vital because working as an engineer is not just about the theory or the experiments, it’s about both, and participating on a team offers that.”</p>



<p>Knowing that these years are full of hard work and important relationships, she also offers,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-emphasize">
<p>“Make the most of the incredible classes at U-M– in my career I used knowledge from <em>every single one</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Much of Albrecht’s career has been dedicated to trying to get more women involved in the aerospace industry. She recognizes that aero doesn’t attract as many women because of the military weaponization of the field and lack of female representation in that area. However, being aware of the importance of female representation as leaders and engineers in academia and corporate work is essential. “There’s more work to be done,” she notes, but having prominent alumna that people– particularly, women– can look up to is essential. Albrecht is proud to have had students contact her, asking for help with resumes and job applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Belcan leaders also met with students in the program, including Sophia Papp, who is leading the Belcan-sponsored cybersecurity project using MBSE design and development principles.&nbsp; The project entails students designing and building a cyber-hardened and cyber-resilient drone, then competing with Belcan engineers to determine who can hack into and defeat the drone. Papp noted the critical role corporate participation plays in the success of the program. “The presence of companies like Belcan gives students real-time feedback on how we can apply what we’re learning and do so in a way that will be industry relevant. This speeds up our learning curve as prospective employees and significantly enhances the output of our work in the lab.”</p>



<p>Belcan joins a variety of aerospace companies who recognize the importance of MBSE in redefining the industry. “By teaching these concepts and developing this lab, the University of Michigan is positioning themselves as leaders in growing the future of the field. MBSE is becoming a high priority, and U-M is providing exactly the framework we need for the next generation of leaders. We are thrilled to be involved in developing the lab,” comments Terry Williams, Belcan’s Chief Information Officer, who is an active participant in the MBSE Lab.</p>



<p>One Belcan team member who was already very familiar with the effort is Parker Trombley (‘21) who was recruited by Belcan based on his involvement in the MBSE Lab. Trombley created the Michigan Vertical Flight Team and led them to two first-place finishes through the MBSE course, highly leveraging the lab’s tools and processes. Trombley comments, “Going through the course was completely transformational for the team. We learned how to develop our systems requirements as we were forming the team and supporting the creation of a national competition. We ended up with great results, winning a national event. The lab gave us the advantage we needed, and this course made a difference in how I view a project and engineering overall.” George Halow, Michigan Aerospace Professor of Practice and head of the MBSE program concludes, “Belcan is showing our students they are committed to helping us develop the programs that give them an advantage. This is the difference maker for them: from the impact they have on campus to the impact they’ll have on day one when they graduate, we see the results that come from Belcan’s support and strategic advice.”</p>

Most recently he served as Assistant Professor at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, TX. We sat down with Limbach to learn more about his research and goals as he gets settled.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What drew you to U-M Aerospace and how do you hope to help make it even better?</strong></p>



<p>U-M is world-renowned for research excellence and leadership in building the future. What drew me to U-M Aerospace was the combination of new opportunities in specific areas &#8211; such as hypersonics, propulsion and space &#8211; but also “big picture” and forward-looking thinking. I’m excited to work with so many talented colleagues to create an exciting future, bringing to bear my own experiences and expertise. For my part, I hope to bring a new perspective as someone with training in laser science, optics, and atomic physics. So many aerospace technologies (for example, <a href="https://www.neubrex.com/htm/applications/gyro-principle.htm">fiber optic gyroscopes</a>, <a href="https://science.larc.nasa.gov/lidar/">remote sensing LIDAR</a> and <a href="https://www.axiomoptics.com/application/free-space-optical-communications/">optical communications</a>) touch on societal challenges such as connecting the world, understanding the earth’s climate, and enabling the human exploration of space. I am thrilled to discuss how these technologies can play a positive role in shaping the future aerospace systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What do you research and why?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>One of the reasons I was drawn to Aerospace Engineering was the wide range of subdisciplines that interact and come together. As a student, and still today, I am amazed and excited by the opportunities to apply my background in physics and optics to the discovery of new solutions and ideas for aerospace systems. My research interests divide into two main areas: optical and laser-based diagnostics, and applications of photonics to flow control and propulsion. Laser diagnostics refers to new ways of measuring processes happening on ultra-fast timescales such as hypersonic boundary layers and pulsed plasmas. The ability to observe, understand and model these physical systems are critical to the design and development of more robust, capable and sustainable flight platforms. On the application side, my research explores new concepts for laser-enabled flow control such as using laser-triggered discharges as actuators. Compared with physical control surfaces, optical and plasma-based systems can achieve the bandwidth needed in high-speed flight.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Why did you become a researcher/faculty member?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>At some point in our academic lives, I hope we all recognize and embrace the unique perspective and creativity each of us brings to new problems and opportunities. In my graduate work, I was fortunate to recognize and embrace the different ways my combination of physics and fluid mechanics background influenced how I formulated and thought about problems. In many ways, I became a researcher because of my profound enjoyment in exploring those new ideas and solving challenging problems. As a faculty member, I also have the honor of sharing and refining my own understanding of science and engineering through interactions with students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What are you most proud of in your work?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In 2018 and 2019 I received two grants from the innovative advanced concepts program at NASA to explore a new physical mechanism to enable <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2019_Phase_I_Phase_II/Self_Guided_Beamed_Propulsion/">beam propulsion</a>. The entire premise of beam propulsion is frankly unconventional: to dispense with reaction mass entirely! Instead, imagine a large, primary spacecraft sending out a directed beam of rarefied gas or laser light which is intercepted by a second spacecraft. The momentum transfer during that interaction then propels the second spacecraft to high velocity, as it carries neither propellant nor a propulsion power source.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am very proud of the work my group has done &#8211; and continues to pursue &#8211; aiming to explore and understand a new concept for beam propulsion. The idea we investigated deals with the essence of how light and matter exchange energy and momentum. We specifically showed that self-guiding of combined laser and matter beams is possible using a combination of light refraction (e.g. the<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/mirage.html"> mirage</a> effect) and optical forces on atoms (e.g. <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=10774">optical tweezers</a>). This has been very exciting research and a risky ‘out there’ idea and I am thankful that NASA saw the value in funding this exciting new concept.</p>



<p><strong>What do you want aerospace students to know about you?</strong></p>

<p>That I am hiring! I have a strong track-record of involving undergraduate and graduate students from many backgrounds and experience in research. There is a standing invitation for every student to stop by my office (but not all at once!) to discuss optics, photonics, lasers, aerospace news, whatever. Optics and lasers are becoming increasingly relevant to the future of Aerospace Engineering. From fiber gyroscopes for spacecraft control, to ultrafast diagnostics for ground testing, to optical communications for deep space, optical technologies will continue to enable flight further and faster than ever before. I’m very excited to engage students in learning about these technologies and how they can shape the future of the profession.</p>



<p><strong>What do you do for fun?</strong>Well I love to run, road bike and swim when possible. Back in college I raced triathlons and long-distance relays but there is less time now. Notably, I biked across the country (Norfolk, VA to San Francisco, CA) in summer 2009 before starting graduate school, which was a fantastic experience that I <a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/">highly recommend</a>. Now I try to get in a 3-4 mile run twice a week. I also frequently enjoy camping and playing with my three kids.</p>
